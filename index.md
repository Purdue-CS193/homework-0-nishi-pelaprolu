# Nishitha's First CS 193 Homework
## Thing I like about CS 193
- It's taught by people that have been through part oc the CS track already
- The ice breakers at the beginning are really fun
- It isn't in a giant lecture hall
- Pretty much everyone is in CS so we can all be confused together
- It seems less intimidating than CS 180
